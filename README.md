# Solution

I met the MVP and bonus goals, and also added some extra stories with Knobs, because they're fun. My solution uses a mix of SASS and MUI customization that probably ought to be more consistent, but it works.

Also, I couldn't fina a way to make my ListCard appear next to the existing Button component on the main app page in an attractive manner, so I hid the Button. Hope you don't mind.
