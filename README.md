# Solution

I met the MVP and bonus goals, and also added some extra stories with Knobs, because they're fun. My solution uses a mix of SASS and MUI customization that I'm not thrilled with, but it works.

Also, there was no way to make my ListCard appear next to the existing Button component on the main app page without looking stupid, so I hid the Button. Hope you don't mind.
