# Solution

I met the MVP and bonus goals, and also added some extra stories with Knobs, because they're fun. My solution uses a mix of SASS and MUI customization that probably ought to be more consistent, but it works.

Also, I couldn't fina a way to make my ListCard appear next to the existing Button component on the main app page in an attractive manner, so I hid the Button. Hope you don't mind.

## Stories

My first three stories meet the MVP requirements. The rest are more complete demonstrations using Knobs.

1. Default - the component with no props
2. Header - the 'header' property is set
3. List Items - the 'items' property is set
4. Change Theme - demonstration of the Bonus Goal; use Knobs to change the theme
5. Dynamic Header - use Text Knob to change header property
6. Dynamic List - use Array Knob to change list values
7. Dynamic List - use Options Knob to change list values
